[*I2S Audio Breakout (DEV-14809)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14809)

The I2S Audio Breakout board uses the MAX98357A digital to analog converter (DAC), which converts I2S (not be confused with I2C) audio to an analog signal to drive speakers. The MAX98357A has a built in class D amplifier which can deliver up to 3.2W of power into a 4â„¦ load. To use this board, all you need is a speaker and a microcontroller that supports I2S. I2S is currently supported on our [SAMD21 Dev Breakout](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13672), [SAMD21 Mini](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13664), [ESP8266 Thing](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13231), and [ESP32 Thing](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13907) boards.
